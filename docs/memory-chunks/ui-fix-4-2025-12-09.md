# Change UI-FIX-4 — interim notes (2025-12-09)

- Added sticky toggle support to ListSurface and enabled on All/Selected/Candidate/Solver/Settings/Sync panels. Sticky applies to header/search/filters; filters area has max-height and its own scroll.
- FilterBar made more adaptive: auto-fit minmax columns, smaller minimum widths, `min-width:0`, advanced section scrollable.
- Dock workspace set to flex column with `min-height: calc(100vh - 96px)`, `.lm_root/.lm_content` `flex:1; min-height:0; overflow:auto` to restore scrolling.
- CourseCard capacity ring uses `clamp(40px, 10vw, 60px)` to avoid hard-coded overflow.
- Group vs section dedupe: in All/Selected/Candidate panels, when expanded, if a section shares time/location with the group primary, time shows as "—" and location is omitted to avoid repetition.
- Design doc updated (openspec/changes/UI-FIX-4/design.md) to reflect sticky/filter/ring clamp strategy.
- Pending/unknown: conflict data source for hover popover; clippath number positioning and extreme narrow fallbacks; any additional filter fields beyond current teaching language/mode/week spans; conflict hover UI shell not yet implemented.
