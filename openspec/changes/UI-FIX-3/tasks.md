# Tasks: UI-FIX-3

- [x] T-1: Build `<PaginationFooter>` (i18n + responsive SCSS) and embed it in AllCourses, SelectedCourses, CandidateExplorer ListSurface footers.
- [x] T-2: Implement clip-path-aware overflow detection in `CourseCalendarPanel.state.ts` plus circled-digit indicators/styling for compact blocks.
- [x] T-3: Share hover state between lists and the calendar via `courseHover` store (`CourseCard` reacts to calendar hover and vice versa).
- [x] T-4: Document validation + PLAN entry, then attempt `npm run check` (record failures blocking automation).
